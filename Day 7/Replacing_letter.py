import random

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.



#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

word = []
num_letters = len(chosen_word)
for i in range(num_letters):
  word += "_" 

print(word)

guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()


for position in range(num_letters):
  letter = chosen_word[position]
  if letter == guess:
    word[position] = letter
print(word)

#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
